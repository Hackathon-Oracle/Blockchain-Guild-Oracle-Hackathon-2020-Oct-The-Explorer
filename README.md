Drug Counterfeiting problem  

As we know drug counterfeiting is a major business problem for pharmaceutical companies around the globe. By some estimates, the global market of counterfeit drugs is as large as 200 billion dollars, which makes it the largest fraud market in the world.
Around the globe, drug counterfeiting is not a huge problem for developed countries, as they have limited distributors with deep market presence and there has been a consolidation of distributors over the years. In contrast, developing countries have a large number of distributors, even at the city level, which results in a fragmented market.
At a regulatory level, reactive efforts include identifying and eliminating counterfeit drugs, and proactive efforts include prescription of interoperable systems to multiple partners for enabling transparency.S
Some reactive efforts employed which includes owning market intelligence, labelling batch codes on drugs, and using barcodes for identifying batches.
However, batch-level barcoding is not entirely useful. On one hand, it improves supply chain efficiency by enabling tracking of sales at the company and trader levels. 
But on the other hand, it is easily replicable; it does not have a central verification system in place and does not enable tracking at an item level.
Here with our solution we are trying to solve the problem at a ROOT level.
